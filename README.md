​ Live Granulation:
​ Made with Chrisopher Poovey's Grainflow:
​ Grainflow Harmonizer





Takes incoming audio and granulates 5 streams, transposed in real-time. The harmonizer transposes at ca. third-tone intervals (about a third of a half-step - 33 cents) for unreal atmospheric harmonies.
​ Grainflow Stochastic 





Granulates incoming audio at a set grain size, but offers many possibilities for pitch change, density and rate of emission. 

# There is a multi-channel version of Grainflow Stochastic which will automatically generate five extra tracks for five separate streams of granules. For this reason, it is only available for Ableton 11 and 12. 

Like the 2-channel version, it granulates incoming audio at a set grain size, but offers many possibilities for pitch change (including glissando), density and rate of emission. 
​ Grainflow V-tap


​ 


This can also be seen as a kind of delay effect, it is a simple live granulator with 5 channels, each having its own speed ranging from 0 to 5 seconds. There is no pitch transposition, unlike the Grainflow Harmonizer. 

​ Gen~ based live Granulator:
​ AZ Polyvoice Live Granulator 







Granulates live incoming-audio with up to 24 voices. This one allows for minute control and modulation of grain size, rate of emission, pitch and position of grain.

​ Delay FX
​ 
​ AZ Modulating Decay







This device can be used as a simple delay effect with variable delay and decay times. A built-in LFO can be set to modulate the delay and/or the decay times individually. Extra-slow and randomization are selectable feature of the built-in LFO.
